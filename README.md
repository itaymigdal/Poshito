*Poshito is a Windows C2 over Telegram*

## Really? Another C2? Why???
I'm not addicted to building C2s â€” I can stop whenever I want!

Just kidding. I've come to terms with the fact that I enjoy building offensive tooling as part of my learning journey. Plus, I like having full control to customize tools my way.

## Ok... nonetheless, what's new here?
Nothing too fancy, really. But some of Poshito's features are:
- Obfuscated Go build using [Garble](https://github.com/burrowers/garble). On top of that, UPX with section name obfuscation is performed (same as [Nimbo-C2](https://github.com/itaymigdal/Nimbo-C2) does).
- C2 over a Telegram channel with password-protected access (no hardcoded chat ID), secured by a hashed password and resistant to tracking tools like [TeleTracker](https://github.com/tsale/TeleTracker)  that require both bot token and chat ID.
- Customizable agents by selectively removing features with Go build tags.
- (Quite) smart and (quite) safe inline .NET assembly execution, where assemblies are allocated once and reused, while patching `Environment.Exit()` to prevent irresponsible assemblies from terminating the agent.
- DRM protection: The agent is restricted to execution on a single Windows machine.
- Easy installation via Docker.
  
## How to use
1. Build and run the provided Docker image:
    ```
    docker build -t poshito .
    docker run -it --rm -v ${pwd}:/Poshito -w /Poshito/Poshito poshito
    ```
    (In Linux replace `${pwd}` with `$(pwd)`)
2. For each new agent, generate a new Telegram bot using the [Bot Father](https://t.me/BotFather). Grab the bot token, and bot URL.
3. Build the agent:

    ```
    /Poshito/Poshito # python3 build.py -h
    usage: build [-h] [-nx] [-ns] [-ng] [-en <name>] [-st SLEEP_TIME] [-sj <percent (%)>] [-dd] [-dr] [-dc] [-ds] [-da] bot_token password {exe,dll}

    Poshito-C2 agent builder

    positional arguments:
    bot_token                                        Bot token
    password                                         Operator password
    {exe,dll}                                        Payload format

    options:
    -h, --help                                       show this help message and exit
    -nx, --no-upx                                    don't UPX
    -ns, --no-upx-sec-obf                            don't obfuscate UPX section names
    -ng, --no-garble                                 don't use Garble (use standard Go compiler)
    -en <name>, --export-name <name>                 dll export name (default: DllRegisterServer)
    -st <seconds>, --sleep-time <seconds>            time to sleep between callbacks (default: 5)
    -sj <percent (%)>, --sleep-jitter <percent (%)>  sleep time jitter in percent (default: 0)
    -dd, --disable-drm                               disable DRM feature
    -dr, --disable-dir                               disable directory view feature (/dir)
    -dc, --disable-clip                              disable clipboard feature (/clip)
    -ds, --disable-screen                            disable screenshot feature (/screen)
    -da, --disable-asm                               disable assemblies loading feature (/asm + /iex)
    ```
4. After the agent execution, send the password to the Telegram bot.

## Commands
```
/info       Send agent information 
/cmd        Execute a command               < command >
/iex        Execute a Powershell command    < powershell command >
/dir        Show directory content          < directory path >
/down       Download a file                 < file path >
/up         Upload a file                   < file to upload > < path to save (optional) >
/clip       Get clipboard content
/screen     Get screenshot
/asm        Execute .NET assembly           < (assembly file | assembly hash) + assembly arguments >
/die        Kill agent
/sleep      Change sleep time               < seconds > < jitter % >
```

> `/asm` will send you the assembly hash on the first execution. use it for further executions of that assembly, see the [example](/Examples/ASM.PNG).
